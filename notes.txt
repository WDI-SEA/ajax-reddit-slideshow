Suggested proccess
------------------------------
It is important to break down any development project in to smaller pieces and tackle them one at a time. Here is a list of how you might want to attack this project.

	Create your form (HTML/CSS)
	Prevent default form submission and verify that you can type something into the form
	Use AJAX to make a request. Show data in console
	Create an array of image URLs (tip: use filter and map).
	Make the form / title / description hide
	Cycle through images
		tip: use setInterval
		Either add images, or change the src of a single image tag
	Add some interesting style / animation
	Create button to stop animation (tip: use clearInterval).
